Voidwyrm API is a mod for ARK: Survival Evolved that hooks event ingame to a REST API to permit for certain customizations in-game without a server restart, or allows for event logging which can be used to create custom commands, tebex support or even creating custom permissions to limit a player! Voidwyrm can be used for preventing cheating.

# Limitations
Voidwyrm API & Voidwyrm Core is using HTTP2 Request Handlers which are Asynced which makes them faster than a normal request but this is not meant to be a replacement for ARK Server API but rather a alternative to which is safer, faster, more dynamic and customizable and easy to understand with our wiki page, forums and documentation!
